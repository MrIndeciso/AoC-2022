# Advent of Code 2022 solutions

## What is Advent of Code?

> Advent of Code (AoC) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

## Which programming languages are the solutions available in?

> We can not guarantee that a solution will be available in every language in this list!

- Python 3
- C
- C++
- Rust

## How can I find the solutions?

There is a folder for every day of the calendar.

In each folder you'll find a `AoC day xx writeup.md` file containing useful informations such as:

- The first and second **problem statement**.
- The first and second **problem inputs**.
- The **idea behind the solution** of bot problems (if a solution was found.)
- All the languages in which the solution has not been wrote yet.

You will also find several folders each named after a programming language. **In those folders you'll find the solution wrote in a specific language** both for the first and second part.

### How can I contribute to this?

If you want to contribute fork this repository and either add a new language or correct a mistake / propose a new solution to an existing one.
